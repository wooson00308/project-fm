Here is a summary of the provided pages from the Model Context Protocol (MCP) documentation:

---

### **Introduction to MCP**

- MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs), akin to how USB-C standardizes device connectivity[^1].
- It enables:
    - Pre-built integrations for LLMs to connect with data and tools.
    - Flexibility in switching between LLM providers.
    - Secure data handling within user infrastructure[^1].
- MCP follows a **client-server architecture**:
    - **MCP Hosts**: Applications like Claude Desktop or IDEs that access data via MCP.
    - **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients maintaining connections with servers.
    - **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs exposing specific capabilities through MCP.
    - **Local Data Sources** and **Remote Services**: Securely accessed by servers[^1].

### **Quickstart: Server**

- This guide demonstrates building an MCP weather server that provides tools for fetching weather forecasts and alerts, connecting it to a host like Claude for Desktop[^2].
- **Core Concepts**:
    - **Resources**: File-like data accessible by clients.
    - **Tools**: Functions callable by LLMs with user approval.
    - **Prompts**: Templates for specific tasks[^2].
- Example implementation includes:
    - Setting up a Python environment with the `uv` tool.
    - Using the National Weather Service API to fetch weather data.
    - Exposing tools like `get-alerts` and `get-forecast` for integration with hosts like Claude for Desktop[^2].
- The server is tested by configuring Claude for Desktop to recognize and interact with it via commands[^2].

### **Quickstart: Client**

- This guide explains building an LLM-powered chatbot client capable of connecting to MCP servers[^3].
- Steps include:
    - Setting up a Python project using `uv`.
    - Storing API keys securely in environment files.
    - Creating a client class to manage server connections and process queries[^3].
- Key functionalities:
    - Connecting to MCP servers via Python or JavaScript scripts.
    - Handling queries by leveraging available server tools and integrating responses into natural language outputs using LLMs like Claude[^3].

---

### **Concepts: Tools**

- Tools are functions exposed by MCP servers, enabling LLMs to perform specific actions. These tools are defined programmatically and can be invoked securely with user consent[^1].
- Example use cases include automating workflows, accessing external APIs, or interacting with local/remote datasets through standardized interfaces[^1].

This documentation provides comprehensive guidance on building both servers and clients using MCP, enabling seamless integration between LLMs and various data sources or tools.
